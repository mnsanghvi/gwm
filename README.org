* GWM: The X11 Generic Window Manager

** Background
GWM initially was Lisp based and had its own Lisp implementation.  With GWM 2.0, it was ported to using Guile.
This was based on Guile 1.8.  This effort is to port GWM to Guile 2.0.11, which is the latest stable version available at the time of writing (2015-05-13).
